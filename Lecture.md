#### What should I learn from this lecture:
1. NavLink, Link
2. Programmatic navigation (from one page to another fter clicking link or button)
3. No Match page (if route is not found)
4. Nested Routes (to make sort of tab navigation inside page, with the use of <Outlet/>, which gives seemless use experience)
5. Index Route (to make child, nested element value on a parents level, i. e. 'default')
6. Dynamic route and  'useParams' to for fetching and displaying element's data based on its id
7. Search Params - (to make filtaration and pagination)
8. Relative Links -
9. Lazy Loading -
10. Authentication and protected routes -
