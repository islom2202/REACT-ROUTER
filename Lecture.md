## Router v6 React
#### What should I learn from this lecture:
1. NavLink, Link
2. Programmatic navigation (from one page to another fter clicking link or button)
3. No Match page (if route is not found)
4. Nested Routes (to make sort of tab navigation inside page, with the use of <Outlet/>, which gives seemless use experience)
5. Index Route (to make child, nested element value on a parents level, i. e. 'default')
6. Dynamic route and  'useParams' to for fetching and displaying element's data based on its id
7. Search Params - (to make filtaration and pagination)
8. Relative Links -
9. Lazy Loading -
10. Authentication and protected routes - 
11. To host on render: 
 - Run this command first:
 ~~~ 
 npm i json-server cors json-serve
 ~~~
 - Then add this inside scripts brace in packages.json: 
 ~~~ 
 "start": "node main.jsx",
 ~~~ 
 - Lastly on Render website if it asks for Build command, in case you use npm:
 ~~~
 npm run build
 ~~~
- For Start Command type this:
~~~
npm run start
~~~
