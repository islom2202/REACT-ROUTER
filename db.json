    "description": "The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser is equal parts luxury SUV and all-terrain workhorse. This three-row SUV has been in the Toyota lineup for decades, though the current model is far from being the utilitarian no-frills conveyance it was years ago. Donâ€™t think the Land Cruiser has gone soft, however. With its powerful V-8 engine, standard four-wheel drive, and lengthy lineup of off-road hardware, this Toyota SUV is one of the most tenacious trucks when the road ahead has other SUVs spinning their wheels in frustration."
